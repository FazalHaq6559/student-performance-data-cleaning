# student-performance-data-cleaning
This project is part of the **Google Data Analytics Certificate**. It focuses on cleaning real-world student performance data from two public high schools in Portugal: **Gabriel Pereira (GP)** and **Mouzinho da Silveira (MS)**. The goal is to prepare the dataset for analysis to help the superintendent understand what factors influence student academic performance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To clean and prepare the dataset by:
- Removing invalid or incorrect entries (e.g., age above the legal limit)
- Filling in missing values (e.g., unknown reasons for school selection)
- Converting text data into numerical format (for statistical analysis)
- Making the dataset ready for data-driven decision-making
