# student-performance-data-cleaning
This project is part of the **Google Data Analytics Certificate**. It focuses on cleaning real-world student performance data from two public high schools in Portugal: **Gabriel Pereira (GP)** and **Mouzinho da Silveira (MS)**. The goal is to prepare the dataset for analysis to help the superintendent understand what factors influence student academic performance.
